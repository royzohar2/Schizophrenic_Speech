The coherence score in the context of this implementation is a measure of how semantically consistent the sentences
within a single text (e.g., an answer to a question) are with each other. It is calculated by comparing the embeddings
of consecutive sentences within the text. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how this score is computed:

1. Sentence Tokenization
The text (e.g., an answer to a question) is first split into individual sentences using common sentence-ending punctuation marks (. ! ?).
Each sentence is then tokenized into words using the hebrew_tokenizer, which extracts relevant tokens like HEBREW words, PUNCTUATION, DATE, and HOUR.

2. Sentence Embedding
Each tokenized sentence is converted into a vector (embedding) using a BERT-based model (in this case, AlephBERT).
BERT models generate embeddings that capture the semantic meaning of a sentence. This process involves:
Feeding the sentence tokens into the BERT model.
Extracting the output of the BERT model, specifically the last_hidden_state, which contains embeddings for each token in the sentence.
Averaging these token embeddings to obtain a single embedding vector representing the entire sentence.

3. Cosine Similarity Calculation
For each pair of consecutive sentences within the text, the cosine similarity between their embeddings is calculated.
Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors in a multi-dimensional space:
Similarity = 1 means the vectors are identical in direction (high semantic similarity).
Similarity = 0 means the vectors are orthogonal (no similarity).
Similarity = -1 means the vectors are diametrically opposite (completely dissimilar).
In practice, cosine similarity values range between 0 and 1 for embeddings, with higher values indicating higher semantic similarity between sentences.

4. Averaging Similarities
The coherence score is the average of all cosine similarity values computed for each consecutive sentence pair in the text.
Higher coherence score: Indicates that the sentences in the text are semantically similar and consistent with each other.
Lower coherence score: Indicates that the sentences might be discussing different topics or are less related, reflecting potential disorganization in thought or topic switching.
